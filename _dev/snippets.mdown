Front-end development as a profession has flourished on the element of free. In fact, when I started to look at paid-for web resources, I had a hard time finding any good examples. As a digital commodity, no front-end code (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) can ever be put up behind a pay wall. Anyone with a browser and the know-how to use View Source

Moving forward, it would be great if the browser vendors started properly documenting how we developers can expect to use hardware acceleration.
